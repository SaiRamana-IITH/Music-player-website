# Spotify-Clone

This is a website similar to Spotify. On this website, we can play and pause the songs. We can also move to previous and next songs. I used HTML which used to build the structure of this website, CSS which is used for styling, and JavaScript which is used for functionality and I linked them to complete this project.

I first created navigation bar at the top left by using nav tag. I have created a container which includes the list of songs by using div tags.

I used different properties like background colour, margin, padding, font-family, font-size, font-weight, flexbox etc to make the website good looking.

In JS I have created an array of objects which includes song name, file path, cover path. Then I added different event listeners like ‘click’. I have made sure that upon clicking, play and pause icons should change accordingly song should play or pause. To keep the progress bar updated, I added event listener ‘timeupdate’. Upon clicking next and previous the next and previous songs have to be played respectively.
